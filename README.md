# Dinosaurs Project

## Introduction

This Project build and infographic comparing a human to different species of dinosaurs. It generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, the name of the human is displayed rather than species and no fact. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden.
The facts displayed should be random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts. One of the titles should be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, "All birds are dinosaurs."
